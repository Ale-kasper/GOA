    <p><strong>Japan</strong> is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland,
         it is bordered to the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea in the south. 
         The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands alongside 14,121 smaller islands, covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi).
          Divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions, about 75% of the country's terrain is mountainous and heavily 
          forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population along its eastern coastal plains. With a population of over 123 
          million as of 2025, it is the 11th most populous country. The country's capital and largest city is Tokyo.</p>

    <h2><b>bachia</b></h2>
    <p>The Hare, commonly transliterated into English as Zayats (Russian: Заяц), is portrayed as a supposedly positive hero. He is less developed than the Wolf, and most of his actions are simply reactions to the Wolf's schemes. In later episodes, the role of the Hare becomes more active and developed, and he even manages to save the Wolf on several occasions. The Hare is portrayed as a percussionist in a number of episodes. The character was originally voiced by Klara Rumyanova..</p>

    <h2><b>volk</b></h2>
    <p>The Wolf, commonly transliterated into English as Volk (Russian: Волк), is initially portrayed as a hooligan who eagerly turns to vandalism, abuses minors, breaks laws, and is a smoker. His appearance was inspired by a person the director Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin saw on the street, specifically a man with long hair, a protruding belly, and a thick cigarette between his lips.[4] The character was originally voiced by Anatoli Papanov.</p>
