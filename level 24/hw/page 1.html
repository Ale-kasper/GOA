<p>Sea bears are a large piranha-like fish species with grizzly/Eurasian brown bear heads who are known for attacking. They come in brown, green, and a lighter green. They first appear in "The Camping Episode."
In their first appearance, sea bears were so rare that many Bikini Bottomites believed them to be a ridiculous myth, including Squidward. However, after season 9, they appear regularly, without being seen as a myth.</p>
